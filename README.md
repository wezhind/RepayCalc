A very simple mortgage repayment calculator. Please do not base any serious financial decdions upon its output, but it will provide a reasonably accurate overview of how long remains until when the mortgage will be paid, and by changing annual interest
 etc, will allow you to estimate how long to pay, based on those changes. 

It also provides an amortization table to give you an idea of how much of the money is going toward interest and principal (assuming you have that type of mortgage). This will not work for mortgages that are interest only payments It is also based on the 
idea that the interest is fixed, so floating rates (obviously) won't be able to be calculated.

Written very quickly in C#, so please let me know if you have any suggestions for improvement, or extra features that you believe would be useful. OR, as the source code is all there and available, download it, and add thems yourself. I probably won't 
spend a huge amount of time thinking of this app again (as I have a day-job and wrote this mainly to work out details of my own mortgage).

Hope it's useful to somebody.
